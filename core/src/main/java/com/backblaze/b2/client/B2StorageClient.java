/*****
 * B2StorageClient is the interface for performing B2 operations.
 * Be sure to close() any instance you create when you are done with it.
 * Try-with-resources can be very useful for that.
 *
 * Here are some design principles:
 *
 *   Be type-safe.
 *   Use different types for requests &amp; responses.
 *   Keep things final.
 *   Use builder classes to instantiate objects
 *     so it's easier to add new attributes.
 *     In addition, we provide convenience methods so the user
 *     doesn't have to use the builder, when the object only
 *     has one or two simple, obvious arguments.
 *
 *   Throw B2Exception, a checked exception, for most problems.
 *
 *  THREAD-SAFETY:  You may call any methods from any thread at any time.
 *    Calls may be blocked waiting for resources, but calling from multiple
 *    threads is safe.  (This assumes the Webifier is thread-safe, and the
 *    default implementation is.)
 *
 *  XXX: how much checking of requests should we do?  for the moment, i'm
 *       inclined to let the server do the bulk of the checking so
 *       (1) i don't have to repeat it here and
 *       (2) i don't have to rev. the client to let people take advantage of
 *           a wider range of inputs, such as more fileInfos.)
 *       we may very well revisit this.

     * to interactions with the server.
     *
     * For instance, for downloading:
     *
     *   * to download files, use downloadByName() or downloadById().
     *
     *   * if you don't want to download directly, but need to give a download
     *     url to some other code, use getDownloadByIdUrl() or getDownloadByNameUrl().
     *
     *   * if neither of those will work for you because you need some other
     *     code to be able to form the download urls itself, you may need to
     *     getAccountAuthorization() and get the downloadUrl from it.
     *
     * For instance, when deciding whether to use uploadSmallFile() or uploadLargeFile(),
     * call getFilePolicy() and use the helper methods on the result.

     * @throws B2Exception if there's trouble getting the authorization.
